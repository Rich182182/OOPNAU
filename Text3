Computer networks have changed the way people talk, learn, work, and play.
Today, we can easily connect with others all around the world.
A network is made of devices and cables that help them communicate.
End devices like computers, phones, and printers are used by people to connect to the network.
Intermediary devices, such as routers and switches, help send data between devices and different networks.

<!-- Networks can be very small or very large, from two computers to millions of devices. -->

People use home networks to share files, print, or play games with others.
Businesses use networks to store information, send emails, and work together.
Many companies also use networks to sell things and talk to customers online.
The Internet is a huge network made of many smaller networks, and it is now part of everyday life.
